## Overview

This reference guide lists each remote type, its supported attributes, and provides examples.

For information on using remotes, see [Remote Training](/remotes.md).

## SSH

<a id="ssh-attributes"></a>

### Attributes

#### `description`

Remote description (string)

#### `host`

Host name to use when connecting to the remote (required string)

#### `port`

The port for SSH connections (integer)

#### `user`

The user for SSH connections (string)

#### `private-key`

Local path to the private key for SSH connections (string)

#### `proxy`

Proxy to use for the SSH connection (string)

#### `connect-time`

Number of seconds to wait for an SSH connection before quitting (integer)

#### `venv-path`

Path to a virtual environment on the remote host (string)

Guild activates the environment for each remote command.

Paths are relative to the remote user home directory.

Virtual environments are standard Python virtual environments that are created with `virtualenv`, `guild init`, or the Python `venv` module.

To strictly control the environment activation, use `venv-activate` instead.

#### `guild-env`

Alias for `venv-path` (see above for details)

#### `conda-env`

Conda environment name on the remote (string)

Guild activates the Conda environment for each remote command. If `guild-env` is also specified, the Guild environment is activated rather than the Conda environment.

#### `venv-activate`

The command used to activate an environment on the remote (string)

Use this to specify the command that Guild uses to activate an environment for remote commands. If this attribute is specified, Guild ignored `guild-env` and `conda-env`.

#### `use-prerelease`

Use pre-release versions for required packages (boolean)

When Guild starts a remote run, it installs the run code along with required Python packages that are specified in the project package definition or in `requirements.txt`. Set this flag to `yes` to instruct Guild to install pre-release versions of required packages.

#### `init`

Shell command to run when the remote is reinitialized (string)

See [Start and Stop](#ssh-start-stop) below for more information about initializing an SSH remote.

### Status

When you run [`guild remote status`](/commands/remote-status), Guild attempts to connect to the remote host over SSH using the specified connect information. If the connect succeeds, Guild considers the remote to be available.

<a id="ssh-start-stop"></a>

### Start and Stop

SSH remotes cannot be started or stopped. Guild assumes that the specified host is available using the specified connect information.

SSH remotes can, however, be initialized using the `--reinit` option to [`guild remote start`](/commands/remote-start). When `--reinit` is specified, Guild runs the shell command defined in the remote's `init` attribute.

Consider the following remote configuration:

``` yaml
remotes:
  my-remote:
    type: ssh
    host: remote-hostname
    init: |
      sudo apt update -y
      sudo apt upgrade -y
```

The command `guild remote start my-remote --reinit` will run the `init` command on the `remote-hostname` host. Use this facility to ensure that the remote is configured correctly before running Guild commands.

### Remote Commands

The commands below can be used with SSH remotes.

### Security

Security is managed by the SSH protocol between the local system (client) and the remote (server). Connection settings are defined as attributes (see above) and by the SSH environment. Refer to the SSH documentation for your system for additional security details.

### Examples

For additional examples, see [Remote Cheatsheet - SSH](/cheatsheets/remotes.md#SSH).

The following is a minimal SSH remote configuration. It used all of the default values. Runs will be located in `~/.guild` on the remote server where `~` is the home directory for the default user associated wit `remote-hostname`.

``` yaml
remotes:
  ssh-remote:
    type: ssh
    description: Remote runs
    host: remote-hostname
```

Note that `ssh` defaults are specified according to the SSH implementation on the local (client) system. Refer to the documentation for your SSH client for details on configuring defaults.

The next example defines additional SSH settings as well as a Guild
environment.

``` yaml
remotes:
  production:
    type: ssh
    description: Production runs
    host: remote-hostname
    user: ubuntu
    port: 2222
    guild-env: ~/Envs/production
    init: test -e ~/Envs/production || guild init -y ~/Envs/production
```

Note that `init` defines a command that creates a Guild environment if one doesn't exist. Use `guild remote start production --reinit` to ensure that the environment is setup correctly before running Guild commands.

## EC2

EC2 provide the same features as SSH remotes. In addition, EC2 remotes can be started and stopped on EC2 by configuring EC2 instance attributes. Refer to [Attributes](#ec2-attributes) below for details.

### Attributes

#### `description`

Remote description (string)

#### `ami`

The AMI used to create the EC2 instance (required string)

#### `instance-type`

The type of EC2 instance to create (required string)

#### `region`

The AWS region to create the EC2 instance in (string)

If this value isn't specified, Guild uses the value defined by the `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variable.

#### `root-device-size`

The size of the root volume created for the server (integer)

If this value is omitted, the default volume size for the AMI is used.

#### `public-key`

Local path to the public key associated with `private-key` (string)

The contents of the local file referenced by this path is included in the remote server's authorized keys for the SSH user.

#### `port`

The port for SSH connections (integer)

#### `user`

The user for SSH connections (string)

#### `private-key`

Local path to the private key for SSH connections (string)

#### `proxy`

Proxy to use for the SSH connection (string)

#### `connect-time`

Number of seconds to wait for an SSH connection before quitting (integer)

#### `venv-path`

Path to a virtual environment on the remote host (string)

Guild activates the environment for each remote command.

Paths are relative to the remote user home directory.

Virtual environments are standard Python virtual environments that are created with `virtualenv`, `guild init`, or the Python `venv` module.

To strictly control the environment activation, use `venv-activate` instead.

#### `guild-env`

Alias for `venv-path` (see above for details)

#### `conda-env`

Conda environment name on the remote (string)

Guild activates the Conda environment for each remote command. If `guild-env` is also specified, the Guild environment is activated rather than the Conda environment.

#### `venv-activate`

The command used to activate an environment on the remote (string)

Use this to specify the command that Guild uses to activate an environment for remote commands. If this attribute is specified, Guild ignored `guild-env` and `conda-env`.

#### `use-prerelease`

Use pre-release versions for required packages (boolean)

When Guild starts a remote run, it installs the run code along with required Python packages that are specified in the project package definition or in `requirements.txt`. Set this flag to `yes` to instruct Guild to install pre-release versions of required packages.

#### `init`

Shell command to run when the remote is reinitialized (string)

See [Start and Stop](#ssh-start-stop) below for more information about initializing an SSH remote.

#### `init-timeout`

Number of seconds to allow the `init` command to finish before timing out (integer)

By default, the `init` command does not have a timeout.

### Status

On [`guild remote status`](/commands/remote-status), Guild attempts to connect to the remote host over SSH using the specified connect information. If the connect succeeds, Guild considers the remote to be available.

### Start and Stop

On [`guild remote start`](/commands/remote-start), Guild uses [](ref:terraform) to start an EC2 instance using the EC2 remote settings. On [`guild remote stop`](/commands/remote-stop), Guild similarly terminates the EC2 instance using Terraform.

### Remote Commands

The commands below can be used with EC2 remotes.

[`guild run`](/commands/run)
[`guild stop`](/commands/stop)
[`guild watch`](/commands/watch)
[`guild check`](/commands/check)
[`guild runs`](/commands/runs)
[`guild runs info`](/commands/runs-info)
[`guild runs delete`](/commands/runs-delete)
[`guild runs restore`](/commands/runs-restore)
[`guild runs purge`](/commands/runs-purge)
[`guild pull`](/commands/pull)
[`guild push`](/commands/push)
[`guild ls`](/commands/ls)
[`guild diff`](/commands/diff)
[`guild cat`](/commands/cat)

### Security

The following environment variables must be defined when starting or stopping an EC2 remote.

| | |
|-|-|
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | The AWS access key ID that has the requisite permissions for starting or terminating the applicable EC2 instance. |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | The AWS secret access key associated with the access key ID. |

The following environment variables may be optionally defined:

| | |
|-|-|
| `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` | The AWS region the remote instance is created in. This value may alternatively be defined in the EC2 remote configuration. |

Once an EC2 remote is created, security is managed by the SSH protocol between the local system (client) and the remote (server).

### Examples

For additional examples, see [Remote Cheatsheet - EC2](/cheatsheets/remotes.md#EC2).

The following is a minimal example of an EC2 remote:

``` yaml
remotes:
  ec2-v100:
    type: ec2
    description: NVIDIA V100 on EC2
    region: us-east-2
    ami: ami-0a47106e391391252
    instance-type: p3.2xlarge
    public-key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    user: ubuntu
```

## S3

Use S3 remotes to store runs remotely. S3 buckets support the full set of remote management commands. See [Remote Commands](#s3-remote-commands) below for details.

### Attributes

#### `description`

Remote description (string)

#### `bucket`

S3 bucket to store runs in (required string)

#### `root`

Path in the S3 bucket to store runs in (string)

#### `region`

AWS region where the bucket was created (string)

The region may alternatively be specified using the `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variable when running a remote command for the S3 remote.

### Status

When you run  [`guild remote status`](/commands/remote-status), Guild checks that the bucket exists and that Guild can read from it. This check does not perform a write test.

### Start and Stop

S3 remotes can be started and stopped. When started, Guild creates the remote bucket as needed. When stopped, Guild deletes the remote bucket if it exists.

> <span data-guild-class="callout important">Important</span> Stopping an S3 remote will delete all contents of the remote bucket, including Guild runs any objects that were copied to the bucket independently of Guild. This operation cannot be undone.

<a id="s3-remote-commands"></a>

### Remote Commands

The following commands can be used with S3 remotes.

[`guild runs`](/commands/runs)
[`guild runs info`](/commands/runs-info)
[`guild runs delete`](/commands/runs-delete)
[`guild runs restore`](/commands/runs-restore)
[`guild runs purge`](/commands/runs-purge)
[`guild pull`](/commands/pull)
[`guild push`](/commands/push)

### Security

The following environment variables must be defined when running any command on an S3 remote.

| | |
|-|-|
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | The AWS access key ID that has the requisite permissions on the remote S3 bucket. |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | The AWS secret access key associated with the access key ID. |

The following environment variables may be optionally defined:

| | |
|-|-|
| `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` | The AWS region associated with the bucket. This value may alternatively be defined in the S3 remote configuration. |

### Examples

The following example stores runs directly in `my-s3-production-runs` bucket.

``` yaml
remotes:
  s3-production:
    type: s3
    description: Production runs
    bucket: my-s3-production-runs
```

You can use `root` to store runs under a bucket path.

``` yaml
remotes:
  s3-test:
    type: s3
    description: Test runs
    bucket: my-s3-runs
    root: test

  s3-production:
    type: s3
    description: Production runs
    bucket: my-s3-runs
    root: production
```
