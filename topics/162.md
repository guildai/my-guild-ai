## Overview

A *dependency* is a file or other resource required by an operation. Dependencies are declared for an operation in a Guild file using the `requires` attribute.

Here's an example of a required *file* dependency:

``` yaml
train:
  requires:
    - file: data.csv
```

When Guild runs an operation, it *resolves* each required dependency. Dependency resolution is specific to each dependency type. File dependencies, for example, are resolved by creating links to required files.

For example, when Guild runs `train` above it resolves the required file `data.csv` as follows:

- Guild looks for `data.csv` relative to the Guild file location.
- If Guild finds `data.csv` it creates a symbolic link named `data.csv` in the [run directory](/t/runs/40#run-directory).
- Otherwise Guild exits with an error message.

Use dependencies to ensure that an operation has what it needs to run.

## Required Resources

Use the `requires` operation attribute to declare that the operation requires one or more resources.

A resource declaration may be one of two types:

- Resource name
- Inline resource definition

Resource definition format is the same in either case. Refer to [*Guild File Reference - Resources*](/reference/guildfile.md#resources) for a complete description of the resource format.

### Named Resources

Resource *names* must refer named resources, defined in a model using [full format](ref:full-format) Guild file.

Below is an example of an operation that requires a named resource.

``` yaml
- operations:
    train:
      requires:
       - data

  resources:
    data:
     - file: data.csv
```

<span data-guild-class="caption">Sample operation using *named resource* `data` --- requires a full format Guild file</span>

The `data` resource defines a single dependency, or *resource source:* a `data.csv` file, located in the project directory. Guild resolves this dependency prior to executing the train script by creating a link to the file in the run directory. If Guild can't resolve the dependency --- e.g. the file is missing --- it exits with an error message.

### Inline Resources

A resource may alternatively be defined *inline* as an item of the operation `requires` attribute.

``` yaml
train:
  requires:
    - file: data.csv
```

Use named resources when more than one operation requires the same resource, or simply to consolidate resource definitions. Otherwise use inline resources.

## Share Resources Across Models

Use `config` objects and inheritance to share resource definitions across models.

Example:

``` yaml
- config: shared-resources
  resources:
    data:
     - file: data.csv

- model: a
  extends: shared-resources
  operations:
    train:
      main: train_a
      requires: data

- model: b
  extends: shared-resources
  operations:
    train:
      main: train_b
      requires: data
```

<span data-guild-class="caption">.Use of inheritance to share a common resource `data` across models</span>

## Dependency Types

Guild supports a number of dependency types, or *resource source* types, which are described below. Refer to [Guild File Reference - Resource Sources](/reference/guildfile.md#resource-sources) for a specification of each type.

### Files

The most common required resource is a *file*. Guild supports different ways to reference files:

- Path relative to the project directory
- URL
- Operation responsible for generating the file

In some cases, Guild resolves multiple files:

- Path or URL refers to an *archive* (e.g. a file ending in `zip`, `tar`, etc.) which Guild unpacks unless `unpack` is set to `no`
- Operation that generates more than one file

In such cases, you may use `select` to limit the resolved files to those matching a pattern.

When resolving *operation* files, Guild first selects a suitable run based on the operation name. Guild uses the following rules when selecting a run, in the order listed:

1. User specified run ID for the resource name
2. Latest marked non-error run matching `operation`
3. Latest unmarked non-error run matching `operation`

Resolved resource links may be renamed using `rename`. This is useful when a script expects a different path.

Examples:

``` yaml
train:
  requires:
   - file: data.csv
```

<span data-guild-class="caption">Sample operation that requires `data.csv` located in the project directory</span>

``` yaml
train:
  requires:
    - url: https://my.co/data.csv
```

<span data-guild-class="caption">Sample operation that requires `data.csv` located by a URL</span>

``` yaml
train:
  requires:
   - operation: prepare-data
     select: data.csv
```

<span data-guild-class="caption">Sample operation that requires `data.csv` generated by the `prepare-data` operation</span>

``` yaml
train:
  requires:
    - file: train-data.csv
      rename: train-data.csv data.csv
```

<span data-guild-class="caption">Sample operation that requires `data.csv` located in the project directory as `train-data.csv`</span>

For more examples, see [Guildfile Cheatsheet - Resources](/cheatsheets/guildfile.md#resources).

### Modules

An operation may require a particular software library, or *module*. Required modules are defined using the `module` type attribute.

``` yaml
train:
  requires:
   - module: pandas
   - module: keras
```

<span data-guild-class="caption">Sample operation that requires two Python modules: `pandas` and `keras`</span>

Guild resolves required modules by verifying they are installed in current environment. If Guild cannot verify a module, it exits with an error message.

> <span data-guild-class="callout important">Important</span> Guild does not *install* modules defined for `requires` --- it merely *verifies* that the modules are available. Ensure that required modules are installed in the environment before running the operation.

Use a required module to preemptively verify that the module is available before starting the script.

### Configuration

An operation can require a configuration file. Guild resolves configuration files by re-writing the specified file to include run flag values.

Guild currently supports only YAML formatted configuration files.

- JSON
- YAML

Consider a sample configuration `config.yml`:

``` yaml
learning-rate: 0.1
batch-size: 100
dropout: 0.2
```

The following operation declares that it requires `config.yml`:

``` yaml
train:
  requires:
    - config: config.yml
```

When Guild resolves the dependency, it re-writes `config.yml` to reflect modified flag values.

Consider the following command:

``` command
guild run train learning-rate=0.2 dropout=0.3
```

Guild writes the resolved `config.yml` as:

``` yaml
learning-rate: 0.2
batch-size: 100
dropout: 0.3
```

<span data-guild-class="caption">Resolved version of `config.yml` reflects the flag values for the run</span>
