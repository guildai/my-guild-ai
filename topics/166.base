## Overview

Guild Compare is a [curses based application ->](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library)) that you run from the command line. It's convenient both for local and remote comparisons as it works equally well over ssh.

Use Guild Compare to view runs in a spreadsheet format including flags and scalar values.

## Start Guild Compare

To start Guild Compare, run:

``` command
guild compare
```

This shows all available runs. You can limit the runs using filters like operation, status, and start time. For a list of filters, see [`compare`](/commands/compare).

By default, Guild Compare runs in *interactive mode*. It runs as an application that lets you explore runs using key commands.

For a list of supported key commands, press `?` when running in interactive mode.

Below are some common actions you perform in interactive mode.

| | |
|-|-|
| Navigate | Use the arrow keys to move the active cell to different rows and columns. |
| Sort runs by a column | Use the arrow keys to navigate to the column you want to sort by. Press `1` to sort in ascending order or `2` for descending. |
| Refresh the display with the latest information | Press `r` (for refresh) at any point to show the latest information. Guild does not automatically update the display. |

<span data-guild-class="caption">Writes runs compare data to `runs.csv`</span>

```

<span data-guild-class="caption">Prints runs compare data to the console</span>

## Compare Tools

Guild supports *tool extensions* that let you compare runs using different tools.

To compare runs using a tool extension, use the `--tool` option with the tool name.

For example, to compare runs using HiPlot, run:

``` command
guild compare --tool hiplot
```

Supported tools:

`hiplot`
: Use [HiPlot ->](https://facebookresearch.github.io/hiplot/) to
  compare runs.

Refer to the sections below for detail on each tool.

### HiPlot

HiPlot is a visualization tool developed by Facebook used to discover correlations and patterns in high-dimensional data. It has a high performance parallel plots graphing engine that can be used as an alternative to TensorBoard's HParams plugin.

To use HiPlot with Guild Compare, first install the HiPlot Python library:

``` command
pip install hiplot
```

Verify that the `hiplot-render` program is installed:

``` command
hiplot-render --help
```

If you get an error, confirm that HiPlot is installed correctly. Refer to [Installing HiPlot](https://facebookresearch.github.io/hiplot/getting_started.html#installing) for help.

To use HiPlot with Guild Compare, run:

``` command
guild compare --tool hiplot
```

Use the `HIPLOT_RENDER` environment variable to specify an alternative location to the `hiplot-render` program. This is useful when running HiPlot from a location that isn't on your system path.
