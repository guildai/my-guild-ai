## Supported Operating Systems

Guild provides precompiled packages that can be installed using [pip](ref:pip). Below is a table listing the supported platforms.

| *Operating System* | *Python Runtime*               |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| Linux              | Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 |
| maxOS 10.14, 10.15 | Python 2.7, 2.6, 3.7, 3.8      |
| Windows 10         | Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7           |

If your operating system configuration is not suppored by one of Guild's precompiled packages, you can try to compile Guild from source by following the steps in [*Install Guild AI - From Source Code*](/install/#from-source-code).

If you need help getting Guild running on your system, please contact us through [](ref:slack) or by [opening an issue on GitHub](ref:open-an-issue).

## Required Software Libraries

Guild requires various software libraries. Each dependency is carefully considered in light of its value to users. If a library does not provide core functionality, Guild is designed to run without it, making it optional.
